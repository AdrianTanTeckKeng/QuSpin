This is a to-do list to update the online package documentation with:

# 1. general evolve
# 3. fix typos in bases (fermions/bosons)
# 5. added feature to * t-dep Hâ€™s
# 6. add link to arXiv example.py
4. Liouville dynamics

Urgent:

# - clear up multiply_hamiltonian branch.
# - block_ops add option to pick which is the full H-space
- block with diag_ensemble

Future work (open an issue)

0. spinful fermions with all symmetries
1. block Liouville dynamics
2. generalize exp_op for ops_dict


New examples

- free particle (large N) with staggered pot and PBC with block tools
- bosons: BHM repulsively bound pairs with ladder with kblock symmetries, non equal time correlator with block tools
- spinful fermions: FHM (MBL) show sympy tool
- spinless fermions/hcb: JW transformation
- spin-1 (maybe Haldane chain?)
- GPE with imaginary time
#- Liouville dynamics
