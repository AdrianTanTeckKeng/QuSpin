This is a to-do list to update the online package documentation with:

- add feature of multiple states to ops.evolve
- Liouville dynamics

Urgent:

- block with diag_ensemble
- update documentation
  * obs_vs_time

Future work (open an issue)

0. spinful fermions with all symmetries
1. block Liouville dynamics
2. generalize exp_op for ops_dict


New examples

- (M) free particle (large N) with staggered pot and PBC with block tools and real space (SSH), non equal time correlator with block tools
- (P) bosons: BHM repulsively bound pairs with ladder with kblock symmetries, show m density sector 
- (P) spinful fermions: FHM (MBL) show sympy tool
- (M) spinless fermions/hcb: JW transformation
- (P) spin-1 TFI vs spin-1/2
- (M) GPE with imaginary time and real time
#- Liouville dynamics
