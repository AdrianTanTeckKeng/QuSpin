Welcome to the official QuSpin documentation website!
=====================================================

QuSpin is an open-source Python package for exact diagonalization and quantum dynamics of arbitrary boson, fermion and spin many-body systems. QuSpin supports the use of various (user-defined) symmetries for one and higher-dimensional lattice systems and (imaginary) time evolution following arbitrary user-specified driving protocols.

This page contains the documentation for the use of all public functions and classes contained in QuSpin.

The source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/weinbe58/QuSpin/tree/master>`_.
