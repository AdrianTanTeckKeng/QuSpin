Lanczos_code

TFLM and LTLM:
	x check for typos
	x Q_iter -> Q 
	x make sure notation with matrix dimensions are consistent. 
	x A_dict -> O_dict
	x remove 'with shape'
	x N -> n
	x n -> m
	x get rid of '*' in notes
	x take M -> n in notes
	x in return: FTLM -> LTLM

Lanczos_basis_full:
	x discuss how Q is returned transposed. Add red note, modify return line.
	x Add note on reorthogonalization, discuss the procedure. 
	x Add note that this implements the classical Lanczos algorithm. Does not handle degeneracies. 
	x change order of eigenvalue decompisition of matrix T in summary.
	x define: eps in terms of inequalities
	x fix return arguments. 

Lanczos_basis_iter:
	x make same changes as in Lanczos_basis_full.
	x explain in more detail about 'copy_v0' and 'copy_A' flag.
	x explain the generator feature better. 

expm_lanczos:
	x Q are not eigenvectors.
	x 'mathrm' in front of exp in summary. 
	x fix notation so that the sizes of arrays are shown. 


lin_comb_Q:
	x weights -> coefiicients.
	x add explicit formula in summary. 
	x add shapes to ndarrays.

lanczos example code:
	x flip daggers on Q everywhere, also flip dimensions of Q. 
	x fix diagonalization of T.
	x close bracket m << n
	* add more explanations

Op_shift_sector

documentation:
	x for parameter 'other_basis': Change '*general_basis*' to 'basis object' and then clarify that the basis must be the same type as the calling basis. 
	x CHECK! add shapes to ndarray
	x add note on how to check if the Op_shift_sector is working properly. 

example:
	x fix math and explanation for autocorrelation
	x explain how to obtain any correlation function (also nonequal space) from the C_q's
	x show generalization to an arbitrary symmetry transformation Q
