branch: Lanczos_code

TFLM and LTLM:
	* Q_iter -> Q
	* make sure notation with matrix dimensions are consistent. 
	* A_dict -> O_dict
	* remove 'with shape'
	* N -> n
	* n -> m
	* get rid of '*' in notes
	* take M -> n in notes
	* in return: FTLM -> LTLM

Lanczos_basis_full:
	* discuss how Q is returned transposed. Add red note, modify return line.
	* Add note on reorthogonalization, discuss the procedure. 
	* Add note that this implements the classical Lanczos algorithm. Does not handle degeneracies. 
	* change order of eigenvalue decompisition of matrix T in summary.
	* define: eps in terms of inequalities
	* fix return arguments. 

Lanczos_basis_iter:
	* make same changes as in Lanczos_basis_full.
	* explain in more detail about 'copy_v0' and 'copy_A' flag.
	* explain the generator feature better. 

expm_lanczos:
	* Q are not eigenvectors.
	* 'mathrm' in front of exp in summary. 
	* fix notation so that the sizes of arrays are shown. 


lin_comb_Q:
	* weights -> coefiicients.
	* add explicit formula in summary. 
	* add shapes to ndarrays.

lanczos example code:
	* flip daggers on Q everywhere, also flip dimensions of Q. 
	* fix diagonalization of T.
	* close bracket m << n

branch: Op_shift_sector

documentation:
	* for parameter 'other_basis': Change '*general_basis*' to 'basis object' and then clarify that the basis must be the same type as the calling basis. 
	* add shapes to ndarray
	* add note on how to check if the Op_shift_sector is working properly.
