Lanczos_code

TFLM and LTLM:
	x check for typos
	x Q_iter -> Q 
	x make sure notation with matrix dimensions are consistent. 
	x A_dict -> O_dict
	x remove 'with shape'
	x N -> n
	x n -> m
	x get rid of '*' in notes
	x take M -> n in notes
	x in return: FTLM -> LTLM
	x `A` object must have `dtype` attribute. !!!!!A is not an argument, also `dtype` not needed for any inputs!!!!!
	x change <Z> to <I> and explain why.
	x explicitly show where the approximation of the identities happen. 
	x make the sum over lanczos vectors explicitly over 1 to m.

Lanczos_basis_full:
	x discuss how Q is returned transposed. Add red note, modify return line.
	x Add note on reorthogonalization, discuss the procedure. 
	x Add note that this implements the classical Lanczos algorithm. Does not handle degeneracies. 
	x change order of eigenvalue decompisition of matrix T in summary.
	x define: eps in terms of inequalities
	x fix return arguments. 
	x `A` object must have `dtype` attribute

Lanczos_basis_iter:
	x make same changes as in Lanczos_basis_full.
	x explain in more detail about 'copy_v0' and 'copy_A' flag.
	x explain the generator feature better. 
	x `A` object must have `dtype` attribute

expm_lanczos:
	x Q are not eigenvectors.
	x 'mathrm' in front of exp in summary. 
	x fix notation so that the sizes of arrays are shown. 
	x explicitly show where the approximation of the identities happen. 
	x make the sum over lanczos vectors explicitly over 1 to m.



lin_comb_Q:
	x weights -> coefiicients.
	x add explicit formula in summary. 
	x add shapes to ndarrays.

lanczos example code:
	x flip daggers on Q everywhere, also flip dimensions of Q. 
	x fix diagonalization of T.
	x close bracket m << n
	* discuss how to use lanczos to find the ground state efficiently compared to scipy. 

lanczos finite temperature lanczos code
	x add comments
	x create example rst page example 21
	x 'nv' -> 'm'
	x in bootstrap 'D' -> 'Ir' and 'N' -> 'Or'
	x 'nsample' -> 'N_r' ?



Op_shift_sector

documentation:
	x for parameter 'other_basis': Change '*general_basis*' to 'basis object' and then clarify that the basis must be the same type as the calling basis. 
	x CHECK! add shapes to ndarray
	x add note on how to check if the Op_shift_sector is working properly. 
	*x check for typo in fourier transform as well as generic expression in the last formula in the equations. (should be fixed, but check!)
	* double check general formula for any symmetry. 

example:
	x fix math and explanation for autocorrelation
	x explain how to obtain any correlation function (also nonequal space) from the C_q's
	x show generalization to an arbitrary symmetry transformation Q




Building dev-0.3.4
-------------------

P fix numpy warning about not supporting generators. Issue 254
P fix numba issue with version and cfunc. Issue 271

x Add cython to manual installation, README and in sphinx
x double check required packages. possibly missing numexpr
P double check documentation for lanczos for correct formulas
P double check Op_shift_sector for correct formulas
x spinful fermion entanglement entropy in general basis
x add error in lanczos for when n > m.
x add error messages for all errors

x in all lanczos files 'Q' -> 'Q_T' (see expm_lanczos, lin_comb_Q) in examples, documentation code snippits
x Note for example19.py add link to Op_shift_sector test for reflection symmetry example. 
x Optional: try to cross reference links to auto generated documentation. 
M list explicitly fixed bugs: Higher-Spin, ent_entropy for spinful_fermion_basis_general.
M expm_multiply_parallel documentation: italics for dtype argument.
M check conda-build recipe
M add example22 on how to use expm_multiply_parallel
M open up issue about unittest package for testing. 
M wrapper for get_vec_inv
M fix NOte in partial trace
